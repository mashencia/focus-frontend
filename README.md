# Focus - Frontend (React)

This is the frontend of **Focus**, a full-stack web application designed to 
assist users in tracking focused work sessions and breaks. The application
also features past session history data, which can later be used to provide 
personalized suggestions on session duration.

The frontend was built using **React** and **Vite**, and communicated with a RESTful API
implemented in **ASP.NET Core** on the backend.
